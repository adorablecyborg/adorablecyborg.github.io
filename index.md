### 👋🏻 sup
Welcome to my little project - it's a work in progress. I'm building this up myself, <b>_without_</b> the aid of AI. Please bear with me. 🙏🏻

<br>

### 🔮 [latest changes](https://github.com/adorablecyborg/adorablecyborg.github.io/blob/main/README.md)
<b>_#_</b> Migrated archive of blog posts from previous blog with author notes for clarity, which can be found on the <a href="/categories/">Categories</a> page.

<b>_#_</b> Added an Archive page for readers to easily access the full list of archived posts from the Categories page.

<b>_#_</b> Adjusted some markdown and HTML on this page's index.md file.

<b>_#_</b> Adjusted the text formatting across the website to be consistent - titles and headers lowercased, with nav links and page names properly capitalized.

- _I don't care if you like it or not - my website, not yours._
